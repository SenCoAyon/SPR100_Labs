## Reflection

Tried to finish this day of, but an error popped up with permission issues, then a git issue where

the repository already existed, then unable to switch to that repository, all while going through essentially 4 different lab computers, and then

this file added some /slashes/, couldn't get the commit to add the folders and readme.md file
